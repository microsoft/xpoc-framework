# Cross-Platform Origin of Content (XPOC) Framework

_This is a pre-release preview of the framework, currently at version 0.3 (see the [changes](./doc/changes.md) history). The specification and sample implementations might change as we continue its development and receive feedback._

This project introduces the Cross-Platform Origin of Content (XPOC) framework, along with a sample implementation. See the [project web page](https://microsoft.github.io/xpoc-framework/).

The aim of the XPOC framework is to allow a person or organization (content owner) to create a authoritative list of:  

1. the various accounts they control over hosting web platforms (such as YouTube, X/Twitter, Facebook, etc.), and
2. the various pieces of content (videos, posts, etc.) they created or approved on these platforms.

Using this framework, content creators protect themselves against falsely attributed accounts or content, by providing signals that can be used by automated validation tools.

A content owner creates a XPOC manifest that contains references to the accounts they control and the content items they created, participated in, or authorized across various platforms, and hosts it on its well-known website. The owner then adds a XPOC URI referencing its own manifest to their platform account pages (bio or profile) and content items. Verifiers can validate the origin of an account or content item by inspecting the content owner's manifest (if known) or by using a XPOC URI, dereferencing it to retrieve the owner's manifest, and verifying that the account or content item is listed within it. For details, see the framework's [specification](./doc//xpoc-specification.md) and the [FAQ](./doc/FAQ.md). You can also participate in the project [discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/xpoc-framework/discussions) to give feedback about the framework.

The repository contains [sample implementations](#sample-implementations) to create XPOC manifests and to verify XPOC content.

## System overview

This section describes the life cycle for data protected using the Cross-Platform Origin of Content framework. The following diagram illustrates the [example](./doc/xpoc-specification.md#example) from the specification.

1. A content owner (Alex Example) creates a XPOC manifest on their website (`alexexample.com`) listing the accounts they control and the content they've created or approved across different platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, X/Twitter).

2. The content owner adds a XPOC URI (`xpoc://alexexample.com!`) to each referenced content item (e.g., in the YouTube video description, in the Facebook post).

3. A verifier can discover a content owner's associated accounts and content by inspecting their manifest.

4. A verifier looking at the content item parses the XPOC URI, fetches the corresponding XPOC manifest, and verifies that the content item is indeed listed therein.

The following [technology overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9OGrOpNif8) and [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNn_ex_J-YA) further illustrate the XPOC framework.

## XPOC library

This project contains a reference implementation in the form of a TypeScript library that can be used to interact with XPOC artifacts. See the [README](./lib/README.md) for more details.

## Sample implementations

The project contains the following sample implementations for the framework (refer to their respective `README.md` for details on how to use them):

-   A client-side HTML portal to create XPOC manifests and verify XPOC resources ([README](./samples/client-side-html/README.md))
-   A backend server using the reference implementation library and a HTML frontend to create XPOC manifests and verify XPOC resources ([README](./samples/server-backend/README.md))
-   A Chrome/Edge browser extension to verify XPOC URIs ([README](./samples/browser-extension/README.md))
